# Contributing to Math W Code

Hi There!👋 Thanks for your interest The team behind **Math W Code** appreciates your interest to help contribute in the project. We want to thank you for joining us, and encourage everyone to provide their input. So, let’s make this fun, creative and productive
let’s build something great together. Just by agreeing to participate you are also agreeing to adhere to a couple of rules.

## Code of Conduct

First things first—please take a moment to review our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT). Let’s make sure this space is respectful and inclusive for all!

## How to Contribute

### Found a Mistake? 💡

Oops, we have committed a mistake our content or perhaps you are a suggestion to make look even better? No worries! That is why you simply need to [open an issue](https://github.com/xirf/mathwithcode/issues). Include as much detail as possible so we can understand what needs fixing.

### Want to Add Something New? 🚀

Have an idea for a new topic or feature? Amazing! Feel free to open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/xirf/mathwithcode/issues). If you prefer to jump straight into a pull request, that’s cool too! Just know that if there’s an issue already assigned to it, we might prioritize that first.

Feel free to sneak in some fun (appropriate!) Easter eggs in the content you create! We love creativity and little surprises, but make sure they don’t distract from the main educational content.

### Ready to Submit Changes? 🛠️

Here's a quick guide to submitting your contributions:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b your-feature-branch`).
3. Work your magic and make your changes!
4. Commit your work with a meaningful message (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
5. Push to your branch (`git push origin your-feature-branch`).
6. Open a pull request on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/xirf/mathwithcode/pulls).

And that’s it—you’re on your way to becoming a contributor!

### Keep It Neat! 📝

When writing or coding, try to stick to these guidelines:

- Follow the existing style of code (no need to reinvent the wheel 😉).
- Write clear, concise commit messages that explain your changes.
- Comment when necessary to explain complex parts.
- Aim for simplicity and clarity—your work should be easy for others to follow.
- Please use proper grammar and spelling. Everyone makes mistakes, but let’s keep them to a minimum.
- Name your files and folders in English and using `kebab-case` (e.g., `linear-algebra`).
- Be as descriptive as possible with your filenames and folder names (keep it short 👀).
- Mixing languages in the same document is fine, but do it sparingly.
- Get creative! You can leave a credit for yourself at the top of the document you created. ✨

### Programming Language Preferences

Ah, we like the simple and functional approach so much! Here are a few preferences:

- Use `JavaScript` instead of `TypeScript`. No need for extra types.
- Prefer `Kotlin` over `Java`. It’s cleaner and less boilerplate.
- If possible skip the main function in `C++`, `Python` and more. We want to keep it simple.
- Avoid adding lesser-known or overly niche programming languages unless necessary.

### Crediting Yourself 🙌

Want to give yourself some credit? Go for it! You can add a little shout-out in the front matter (top of document) of the document using this format:

```markdown
---
contributors:
  - name: "Your Name"
    username: "Your GitHub Username"
---
```

Feel free to update the contributors' widget in `docs/.vitepress/theme/components/ContributorsAside.vue` to add more details about yourself—but make sure you don’t break the existing format! If it does break, it’s up to you to fix it. 😇

> [!INFO] Please add yourself to the contributors list
> After contributing to the project, please add yourself to the contributors list in the `docs/.vitepress/contributors.ts` file. This will show your account in the homepage of the project.

### The Review Process

Once you submit a pull request, one of our maintainers will review it. We may suggest a few tweaks, but don’t worry—we’ll provide feedback as quickly as possible and work with you to get your contributions merged!
