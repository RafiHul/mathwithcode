# Learning Guide

Before you begin, there are a few important things you need to know. **Math W Code** is a place to learn and share about mathematics with the help of programming languages. Here, you can learn while also contributing to the development of mathematical knowledge through code!

## Requirements

Our focus is on how mathematical concepts are applied in programming. Therefore, we will not discuss things like how to install a code editor, write basic code, and so on, however we will cover some basic programming concepts.

So, before you start, we hope you already understand the basic of programming, you don't need to be very good at it though. But it's important that you can understand the codes we will discuss.

## Programming Languages

In this site, we will use various programming languages to explain mathematical concepts. Some of the languages ​​we will use are:

<div class="grid md:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
    <div class="flex gap-4 py-2 px-4 border-1px border-gray-400/25 items-center border-solid h-full w-full rounded-lg w-full max-w-xs mt-0!">
        <span class="i-logos-javascript" data-icon="logos:javascript" data-inline="false"></span> <span>Javascript</span>
    </div>
    <div class="flex gap-4 py-2 px-4 border-1px border-gray-400/25 items-center border-solid h-full w-full rounded-lg w-full max-w-xs mt-0!">
        <span class="i-logos-c-plusplus" data-icon="logos:cpp" data-inline="false"></span> <span>C++</span>
    </div>
    <div class="flex gap-4 py-2 px-4 border-1px border-gray-400/25 items-center border-solid h-full w-full rounded-lg w-full max-w-xs mt-0!">
        <span class="i-logos-kotlin-icon" data-icon="logos:javascript" data-inline="false"></span><span>Kotlin</span>
    </div>
    <div class="flex gap-4 py-2 px-4 border-1px border-gray-400/25 items-center border-solid h-full w-full rounded-lg w-full max-w-xs mt-0!">
        <span class="i-logos-python" data-icon="logos:python" data-inline="false"></span><span>Python</span>
    </div>
</div>

Each language has its own unique way of handling mathematics. So, get ready to explore many new things on this learning journey!

In some materials, the programming language mentioned may not be available.

Don’t worry, you can still follow the concepts taught in other languages that are available. The concepts aren't too different, after all. The key is to focus on the implementation, okay!
